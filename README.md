# World_Weather_Analysis


## Overview of Project:
PLANMYTRIP Head of Analysis has asked us to help on a new project in order to find the ideal hotel all over the world. What's the best time of the year for people to go on vacation is the main question to be answer here! Let's get started!

### Purpose
During this module we learnt how to analyse, visualize, make statistical analysis and retrieve Data from an API for a weather data app that helps users get the most out of their vacations.

## Deliverable 1

Using API calls we were able to retrieve data from cities all over the world, it is amazing what this method can do with just a few lines of code. Main challenge here is to be familiarized with the documentation for each API.

## Deliverable 2
Using Google maps API can be challenging but without questions it is a powerful tool that can be used with ease when understood correctly, it is awesome to have some visualizations on your work, as people say, one image is worth more than a thousand words.

## Deliverable 3

Getting all the information to actually make life easier to our customers is the main purpose of the analysis, and the goal has been achieved by presenting this summarized version of the work done.

## Results and Conclusions

API's help automate tasks as well as to get information gathered properly. For sure there's a lot to be practiced but a new world of possibilities has been open :D!
